# Static Canvas & Realtime Sync Fixes

**Date**: October 19, 2025
**Branch**: feat/static-canvas-migration
**Status**: ✅ Complete

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Object Culling for Static Canvas
**Problem**: Culling logic was using old viewport transform calculations instead of scroll position
**Impact**: Objects were incorrectly hidden even when they should be visible

**Fix**: Updated `FabricCanvasManager.updateObjectCulling()` to use scroll position:
```typescript
// OLD (viewport transform-based):
const viewportLeft = -rect.left;
const viewportTop = -rect.top;

// NEW (scroll position-based):
const scrollLeft = scrollContainer.scrollLeft;
const scrollTop = scrollContainer.scrollTop;
const viewportLeft = scrollLeft;
const viewportTop = scrollTop;
```

**Files Changed**:
- `src/lib/fabric/FabricCanvasManager.ts` (lines 295-333)

---

### 2. ✅ Layers Realtime Sync
**Problem**: Layers were not syncing between users - User 1 creates object → User 2 doesn't see it in layers panel
**Impact**: Inconsistent layers panel state across users

**Fix**: Added layer creation in realtime INSERT handler:
```typescript
_addObject: (object: CanvasObject) => {
  set((state) => {
    state.objects[object.id] = object;
  });
  
  // REALTIME LAYERS FIX: Sync layer to other users
  get().addLayer(object.id, {
    name: `${object.type} ${object.id.slice(0, 6)}`,
    visible: true,
    locked: false,
  });
}
```

**Files Changed**:
- `src/stores/slices/canvasSlice.ts` (lines 823-844)

---

### 3. ✅ Layer Ordering Consistency
**Problem**: Layers were being added in random order instead of z_index order
**Impact**: Layer panel showed different order on different clients, required refresh to fix

**Fix**: Sort objects by z_index before adding layers on canvas load:
```typescript
// LAYER ORDERING FIX: Sort by z_index before adding layers
const sortedObjects = Object.values(objectsMap).sort((a, b) => a.z_index - b.z_index);
sortedObjects.forEach((obj) => {
  get().addLayer(obj.id, { ... });
});
```

**Files Changed**:
- `src/stores/slices/canvasSlice.ts` (lines 428-437)

---

### 4. ✅ Outdated Comments Cleanup
**Problem**: Comments referenced "5000x5000 canvas" instead of "8000x8000 canvas"
**Impact**: Misleading documentation

**Fix**: Updated comments to reflect correct 8000x8000 canvas size

**Files Changed**:
- `src/lib/fabric/FabricCanvasManager.ts` (lines 279, 1315)

## How Layers Now Work

### Before (Broken):
```
User 1 creates object:
  ✅ Object synced via Supabase realtime (INSERT event)
  ✅ User 1 sees layer (added locally)
  ❌ User 2 doesn't see layer (not added on INSERT)

User 2 refreshes:
  ✅ Objects loaded from database
  ✅ Layers created on load
  ⚠️  But in wrong order (not sorted by z_index)
```

### After (Fixed):
```
User 1 creates object:
  ✅ Object synced via Supabase realtime (INSERT event)
  ✅ User 1 sees layer (added locally)
  ✅ User 2 sees layer immediately (_addObject calls addLayer)
  ✅ Both users see same order (sorted by z_index)

On page load:
  ✅ Objects loaded from database
  ✅ Layers created in z_index order
  ✅ Consistent across all users
```

## Testing Checklist

### Object Culling
- [ ] Create objects near viewport edges
- [ ] Scroll around canvas - objects should remain visible
- [ ] Check console - should see fewer/no "Culled X objects" messages

### Layers Realtime Sync
- [ ] User 1: Create a shape
  - [ ] User 1 sees layer in layers panel ✓
  - [ ] User 2 sees layer in layers panel immediately (no refresh) ✓
- [ ] User 2: Create a shape
  - [ ] User 2 sees layer in layers panel ✓
  - [ ] User 1 sees layer in layers panel immediately (no refresh) ✓

### Layer Ordering
- [ ] Create 3 shapes in order: Rectangle, Circle, Text
- [ ] Both users should see same order in layers panel
- [ ] Refresh page - order should remain consistent
- [ ] Change z-index (bring to front/back) - order updates on both clients

### Shape Placement
- [ ] Click to place shape - should appear at click position
- [ ] Check console logs for coordinate flow
- [ ] Shapes should be visible in viewport (not culled)

## Architecture Notes

### Layers Are Now Fully Synced
Layers are derived from canvas_objects table via realtime subscription:
- `INSERT` → calls `_addObject` → calls `addLayer`
- `DELETE` → calls `_removeObject` → calls `_cleanupDeletedObjects` → calls `removeLayer`
- On load → objects sorted by z_index before adding layers

### Object Culling with Static Canvas
The 8000x8000 canvas is inside a scrollable container:
- Viewport bounds = scroll position + container dimensions
- No viewport transform calculations needed
- Culling based on scroll position, not transform matrix

## Performance Impact

### Positive
- ✅ Correct culling reduces unnecessary rendering
- ✅ Sorted layer insertion is one-time cost on load
- ✅ No extra database queries (layers derived from objects)

### Neutral
- Layers now sync via realtime (small payload increase per INSERT)
- Sort operation on load (negligible for <1000 objects)

## Next Steps

1. **User Testing**: Verify all fixes work in production
2. **Monitor Performance**: Check culling effectiveness with large canvases
3. **AI Integration**: Proceed with AI_MASTER_TASK_LIST.md Phase III
