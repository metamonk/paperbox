## 🔧 Setup Required

### 1. Set OpenAI API Key (Required)

You need to configure your OpenAI API key in two places:

#### A. Local Development (.env.local)
Create `.env.local` in the project root:
```bash
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-openai-api-key" > .env.local
```

#### B. Supabase Edge Function
Set the secret for production:
```bash
supabase secrets set OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-openai-api-key
```

### 2. Verify Edge Function Deployment

The Edge Function has been deployed. You can verify it in your Supabase dashboard:

## 🎮 How to Use

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Open AI Mode**: Press `/` or `Cmd+/`
- **Close AI Mode**: Press `Esc`
- **Submit Command**: Press `Enter`
- **Undo AI Actions**: Press `Cmd+Z` (standard undo)

### AI Mode Toggle

1. Click the sparkles (✨) icon in the Bottom Toolbar
2. Or use the `/` or `Cmd+/` keyboard shortcut
3. The toolbar will hide and the AI text box will appear

### Example Commands

**Creation Commands:**
- "Create a red circle at the center"
- "Add a blue rectangle"
- "Create text that says 'Hello World'"
- "Make a 200x300 rectangle at position 100, 150"
- "Create a large green circle"
- "Add a small text label"

**Context-Aware Commands:**
- "Create a circle" → Places at viewport center
- "Add a rectangle here" (with selection) → Places near selected object
- "Make a circle at the top left"
- "Create text at the bottom right"

**Color Support:**
- Color names: "red circle", "blue rectangle", "green text"
- Hex colors: "Create a circle with fill #ff0000"
- Default colors are used if not specified

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Basic Creation Tests

- [ ] Open AI mode with `/` key
- [ ] Type: "Create a red circle at the center"
- [ ] Press Enter and verify circle appears
- [ ] Verify streaming response shows in popover
- [ ] Press `Cmd+Z` to undo and verify circle disappears
- [ ] Press `Cmd+Shift+Z` to redo and verify circle reappears

### Additional Creation Tests

- [ ] "Add a blue rectangle" → Creates rectangle at center
- [ ] "Create text that says 'Hello World'" → Creates text
- [ ] "Make a 200x300 rectangle at position 100, 150" → Specific size/position
- [ ] "Create a large green circle" → AI infers large size (radius ~100px)

### Context Awareness Tests

- [ ] Select an object, then: "Create a circle here" → Places near selection
- [ ] Zoom in/out, then: "Create a rectangle at the center" → Uses current viewport center
- [ ] Pan to different area: "Add a circle" → Places at new center

### Performance Tests

- [ ] Measure time to first token (should be < 2 seconds)
- [ ] Verify streaming response appears immediately
- [ ] Verify canvas updates in real-time as tool calls execute

### Error Handling Tests

- [ ] Try without OpenAI API key → Should show error message
- [ ] Try with invalid command → Should show graceful error
- [ ] Try while offline → Should show network error

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Missing authorization header" error
- Make sure you're logged into Paperbox
- Check browser console for auth errors

### "OpenAI API key not configured" error
- Run: `supabase secrets set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key`
- Verify key is set: `supabase secrets list`

### AI not responding
1. Check Supabase Edge Function logs:
   ```bash
   supabase functions logs ai-command
   ```
2. Verify OpenAI API key is valid
3. Check browser Network tab for failed requests

### Objects not appearing
1. Check browser console for command execution errors
2. Verify commands are registered (should see "Registered 3 creation commands" in console)
3. Check if canvas is initialized properly

### Streaming not working
1. Check if Edge Function is deployed: `supabase functions list`
2. Verify CORS headers are set correctly
3. Check browser console for SSE connection errors

## 📊 Architecture Overview

```
User Input (AITextBox)
    ↓
useAICommand Hook
    ↓
Supabase Edge Function (/functions/ai-command)
    ↓
OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo + Tool Calling
    ↓
Streaming Response (SSE)
    ↓
Client-Side Command Execution
    ↓
Command Pattern (CreateCircle/Rectangle/Text)
    ↓
Zustand Store → Fabric.js → Canvas
    ↓
Supabase Realtime Sync
```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Client-Side Execution**: AI streams tool calls, client executes via Command pattern
   - Benefit: Leverages existing undo/redo infrastructure
   - Benefit: Direct access to Zustand store and Fabric.js

2. **Canvas Context**: AI receives full viewport state
   - Enables smart positioning ("at the center" = viewport center)
   - Enables contextual commands ("create here" = near selection)

3. **Streaming Responses**: Real-time feedback via SSE
   - Sub-2s time to first token
   - Shows AI thinking process
   - Better UX than waiting for full response

4. **Command Pattern Integration**: All AI actions use Command classes
   - Full undo/redo support
   - Consistent with manual actions
   - Easy to test and extend

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (Testing)
1. Set your OpenAI API key in both `.env.local` and Supabase secrets
2. Run `pnpm dev` and test the basic creation commands
3. Verify undo/redo works with AI-created objects
4. Test performance (< 2s time to first token)

### Short-Term (Enhancement)
1. Add manipulation commands (Move, Resize, Rotate)
2. Add layout commands (Align, Distribute)
3. Improve error handling and user feedback
4. Add loading states and progress indicators

### Long-Term (Polish)
1. Add complex multi-step commands
2. Implement AI suggestions based on canvas state
3. Add command history and favorites
4. Performance optimization and caching
5. User feedback collection (thumbs up/down)

## 📝 Implementation Notes

### Dependencies Added
- `ai@5.0.76` - Vercel AI SDK for streaming

### Zod Version
Using `zod@4.1.12` (already in project) for schema validation

### Edge Function
- Deployed to: `https://snekuamfpiwauvfyecpu.supabase.co/functions/v1/ai-command`
- Uses GPT-4 Turbo for fast responses
- Supports up to 5 tool execution steps
- Returns SSE stream for real-time updates

### Command Classes
All command classes follow the same pattern:
- Extend `BaseCommand`
- Implement `execute()`, `undo()`, `getDescription()`, `getMetadata()`
- Register in CommandRegistry
- Support undo/redo via history slice
