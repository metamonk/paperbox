# AI Integration Guide - Paperbox

> **Natural language commands for your collaborative canvas**

Paperbox includes a powerful AI assistant that lets you create, modify, and arrange design elements using natural language. Just describe what you want, and the AI will execute it instantly.

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Activating AI Mode

Press `/` or `Cmd+/` to toggle between **Tools Mode** and **AI Mode**.

When AI mode is active, you'll see a text input box at the bottom center of your canvas:

```
‚ú® Ask AI to create, modify, or arrange...                    ‚èé
```

### Basic Usage

1. **Type your command** in natural language
2. **Press Enter** to execute
3. **Watch the AI work** - objects appear instantly
4. **Use Cmd+Z** to undo if needed

## üìù Command Categories

The AI supports 11 distinct command types across 4 categories:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Creation Commands** (3 types)

Create shapes and text on your canvas.

**Examples:**
- "Create a red circle"
- "Add a blue rectangle"
- "Make a text that says 'Hello World'"
- "Create a green circle at position 100, 200"
- "Add a 200x300 rectangle to the right"

**Supported Shapes:**
- **Circles**: `radius`, `fill`, `stroke`, `stroke_width`, `opacity`
- **Rectangles**: `width`, `height`, `fill`, `stroke`, `stroke_width`, `opacity`, `corner_radius`
- **Text**: `text`, `fontSize`, `fontFamily`, `fontWeight`, `fill`, `opacity`, `textAlign`

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Manipulation Commands** (3 types)

Modify existing objects. **Note**: You must select objects first!

#### Move Objects
- "Move this to the right by 100 pixels"
- "Move it to position 400, 300"
- "Shift this left by 50"

#### Resize Objects
- "Make this bigger"

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Style Commands** (1 type)

Change the appearance of selected objects.

- "Align right" - Align to rightmost edge
- "Align top" - Align to topmost edge
- "Center vertically" - Align to vertical center
- "Align bottom" - Align to bottommost edge

#### Distribute Objects
Space objects evenly.

**Examples:**
- "Distribute horizontally" - Even horizontal spacing
- "Space them evenly" - Even spacing (inferred direction)
- "Distribute vertically" - Even vertical spacing
- "Space them 50 pixels apart horizontally" - Fixed spacing

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Complex Commands** (2 types)

Create multiple objects in patterns.

#### Grid Layouts

**Examples:**
- "Create a 3x3 grid of circles"
- "Make a 2x4 grid of squares"
- "Create a 5x5 grid of small red circles"
- "Make a 3x2 grid of rectangles"

**Parameters:**
- `rows` - Number of rows

## üéØ Pro Tips

### Positioning

**The AI is context-aware!** It knows where you're looking.

- **"Create a circle"** ‚Üí Appears at the center of your current viewport
- **"Add a rectangle to the right"** ‚Üí Offset from viewport center
- **"Create at 100, 200"** ‚Üí Exact coordinates

### Selection Context

The AI understands which objects you've selected:

- **"Make this bigger"** ‚Üí Resizes first selected object
- **"Align left"** ‚Üí Aligns all selected objects
- **"Change these to blue"** ‚Üí Changes color of selected objects

**Important**: If nothing is selected and you say "move this", the AI will ask you to select an object first.

### Natural Language

The AI understands variations:

- ‚úÖ "Create a red circle"
- ‚úÖ "Make a circle that is red"
- ‚úÖ "Add a red circular shape"
- ‚úÖ "I want a circle, make it red"

### Size Shortcuts

- "Small circle" = 30px radius
- "Large rectangle" = 300x200px
- Default circle = 50px radius
- Default rectangle = 150x100px
- Default text = 24px font size

### Color Shortcuts

You can use:
- **Color names**: red, blue, green, yellow, purple, orange, black, white
- **Hex codes**: #ff0000, #00ff00, #0000ff
- **RGB**: (coming soon)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Please select an object first"

**Problem**: You asked to modify something, but nothing is selected.

**Solution**: Click on the object you want to modify, then try again.

---

### "Need at least 2 objects to align"

**Problem**: Align requires multiple objects.

**Solution**: Select 2+ objects by clicking while holding Shift, then try again.

---

### "Need at least 3 objects to distribute"

**Problem**: Distribute requires 3+ objects.

**Solution**: Select 3+ objects, then try again.

---

### Objects created off-screen

**Problem**: Objects appear far from where you're looking.

**Solution**: The AI uses your viewport center by default. Pan to the area where you want objects, then create them.

## üé® Examples Gallery

### Create a Login Form

```
"Create a login form"
```

The AI will create:
- "Username" label
- Username input field
- "Password" label
- Password input field
- "Login" button

All properly positioned and sized!

---

### Create a Color Palette

```
"Create a row of 5 circles with different colors"
```

(Then manually adjust colors, or specify: "red, blue, green, yellow, purple")

---

### Build a Dashboard Grid

```
"Create a 3x2 grid of rectangles"
```

Perfect starting point for dashboard cards!

---

## üîí Limitations

1. **Single canvas only** - AI operates on the active canvas
2. **No image import** - AI can't fetch external images (yet)
3. **No complex paths** - Bezier curves require manual creation
4. **English only** - AI understands English commands only (for now)
5. **Selection required** - Manipulation commands need objects selected first
