# Phase II Task Management System

## System Complete

**Date**: 2025-10-16
**Status**: ✅ Ready for Execution

## Documents Created

1. **MASTER_TASK_LIST.md** - 370+ tasks for entire 12-week implementation
   - Week 1-2: Detailed day-by-day tasks (critical path)
   - Week 3-12: Feature-level tasks (parallel execution)
   - TDD integration: Red → Green → Refactor pattern
   - Context7 documentation fetch points embedded
   - /sc:test command scheduled (18 validation gates)

2. **TASK_TRACKING_GUIDE.md** - Complete usage guide
   - Chunking mechanism (W#.D#.# format)
   - Filtering strategies (week/day/category)
   - Daily/weekly/milestone workflows
   - TDD task patterns
   - Context7 integration patterns

3. **Templates Updated** - Starter code templates in docs/templates/
   - FabricCanvasManager.template.ts
   - canvasStore.template.ts
   - Command.template.ts

## Task Organization

**ID Format**: W#.D#.# (Week.Day.Task)
- Example: W1.D1.1 = Week 1, Day 1, Task 1

**Task Categories**:
- [Context7] = Documentation fetch (10 tasks)
- [RED] = Write failing test (TDD)
- [GREEN] = Implement to pass test (TDD)
- [REFACTOR] = Clean up code (TDD)
- [TEST] = Execute /sc:test (18 validation gates)
- [VALIDATE] = Milestone quality gate (6 gates)
- [COMMIT] = Git checkpoint

**Task Distribution**:
- Week 1-2 (Critical Path): 100 tasks (~10/day)
- Week 3-12 (Features): 250 tasks (~5/day)
- Validation/Testing: 18 tasks
- Total: ~370 tasks

## Chunking System

**Week-Level**: Filter by `W3.` → Shows all Week 3 tasks
**Day-Level**: Filter by `W3.D2.` → Shows Week 3, Day 2 tasks
**Category**: Filter by `[TEST]` → Shows all test execution tasks

## TDD Integration

Every implementation follows:
1. W#.D#.X: Write test [RED] - Expect failure
2. W#.D#.Y: Implement feature [GREEN] - Pass test
3. W#.D#.Z: Refactor code [REFACTOR] - Maintain passing tests
4. W#.D#.W: Validate - pnpm test + typecheck

## Test Command Schedule

**Weekly Validations** (12 executions):
- End of each week: `/sc:test` for coverage analysis
- Target coverage progression: 30% → 80%

**Milestone Validations** (6 executions):
- Milestone 1 (Week 2): Foundation complete, >40% coverage
- Milestone 2 (Week 4): Core features, >55% coverage
- Milestone 3 (Week 6): Styling complete, >65% coverage
- Milestone 4 (Week 8): Layout complete, >72% coverage
- Milestone 5 (Week 10): Advanced features, >76% coverage
- Milestone 6 (Week 12): Production ready, >80% coverage

## Context7 Integration

Documentation fetches embedded at critical points:
- W1.D1.1: Fabric.js canvas initialization
- W1.D3.1: Zustand with immer middleware
- W1.D5.1: Command pattern best practices
- W2.D1.1: Selection patterns
- W2.D4.1: Realtime subscription patterns
- W3.D1.1: Lasso selection patterns
- W3.D2.1: Transform patterns
- ... (10 total Context7 tasks)

## User Preferences Applied

1. **Full 12-week list** - All 370 tasks in single document
2. **Chunking for focus** - W#.D#.# format enables filtering
3. **Specific tasks** - Detailed, sequential, complete tasks
4. **TDD baked in** - Red/Green/Refactor pattern throughout
5. **Test command scheduled** - 18 validation gates embedded
6. **Context7 integration** - Documentation fetches at critical points
7. **No inline docs** - Context7 used during implementation only

## Next Steps

User should:
1. Open MASTER_TASK_LIST.md
2. Start with W1.D1.1
3. Filter to current week/day for focus
4. Follow TDD pattern for each feature
5. Execute /sc:test at validation gates
