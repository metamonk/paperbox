# Phase 2, Week 2, Day 1: Selection Mode Management - COMPLETE ✅

**Date**: October 17, 2025
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Commit**: `674062d` - feat(stores): Add selection mode management to selectionSlice
**Tests**: 49 passing (45 selection + 4 integration)

---

## Summary

Successfully extended the selectionSlice (implemented in Week 1) with comprehensive selection mode management. Added `selectionMode` state with four modes ('single', 'multi', 'lasso', 'drag') and intelligent mode switching logic that preserves or clears selections based on mode transitions.

---

## What Was Completed

### 1. Selection Mode State & Type System
**File**: [src/stores/slices/selectionSlice.ts](../src/stores/slices/selectionSlice.ts)

**Changes**:
- Added `SelectionMode` type: `'single' | 'multi' | 'lasso' | 'drag'`
- Added `selectionMode: SelectionMode` to `SelectionSlice` interface
- Initial state defaults to `'single'`

**Purpose**: Provides type-safe selection mode management for different interaction patterns.

### 2. setSelectionMode() Action
**File**: [src/stores/slices/selectionSlice.ts](../src/stores/slices/selectionSlice.ts:155-178)

**Implementation**:
```typescript
setSelectionMode: (mode: SelectionMode) =>
  set(
    (state) => {
      const previousMode = state.selectionMode;
      state.selectionMode = mode;

      // Clear selection when switching from multi to single
      if (previousMode === 'multi' && mode === 'single') {
        state.selectedIds = [];
        state.activeObjectId = null;
      }

      // Clear selection when switching to lasso or drag mode
      if (mode === 'lasso' || mode === 'drag') {
        state.selectedIds = [];
        state.activeObjectId = null;
      }

      // Preserve selection when switching from single to multi
    },
    undefined,
    'selection/setSelectionMode',
  )
```

**Logic**:
- **multi → single**: Clears selection (prevent invalid multi-select state)
- **single → multi**: Preserves selection (allow expanding selection)
- **→ lasso/drag**: Clears selection (transient drawing modes need clean slate)

### 3. Comprehensive Test Coverage
**File**: [src/stores/__tests__/selectionSlice.test.ts](../src/stores/__tests__/selectionSlice.test.ts)

**Added Tests** (11 new selection mode tests):
1. Default mode is 'single'
2. Mode changes to 'multi', 'lasso', 'drag'
3. Multi→single clears selection
4. Single→multi preserves selection
5. →Lasso clears selection
6. →Drag clears selection
7. Multi mode allows multiple selections
8. Single mode replaces selection

**Integration Tests** (4 new tests):
1. Selection mode maintained when canvas objects added
2. Multi-selection works with canvas objects
3. Selection state independent of canvas object removal
4. Mode switching works correctly with active canvas selections

**Total Coverage**: 49 tests (34 from Week 1 + 15 new)

### 4. Fabric.js Event Integration
**Status**: ✅ Already implemented in Week 1

**File**: [src/lib/sync/CanvasSyncManager.ts](../src/lib/sync/CanvasSyncManager.ts:71-84)

The CanvasSyncManager already wires Fabric.js selection events to the store:
- `onSelectionCreated` → `selectObjects()`
- `onSelectionUpdated` → `selectObjects()`
- `onSelectionCleared` → `deselectAll()`

The new selection mode functionality integrates seamlessly with this existing wiring.

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Mode Switching Logic
**Decision**: Different clearing behavior based on mode transitions

**Rationale**:
- **Multi→Single clearing**: Prevents invalid state where multiple objects are selected but mode only allows single selection
- **Single→Multi preservation**: User expectation - switching to multi mode should allow expanding current selection, not clear it
- **Lasso/Drag clearing**: These are transient drawing modes that need a clean canvas state

### 2. Selection State Independence
**Decision**: Selection IDs remain even if canvas objects are removed

**Rationale**:
- Separation of concerns - selection state tracks intent, not validity
- Cleanup handled by sync layer (CanvasSyncManager)
- Allows for graceful handling of object removal/deletion scenarios

### 3. Type Safety
**Decision**: Used TypeScript union type for SelectionMode

**Benefits**:
- Compile-time validation of mode values
- IDE autocomplete for valid modes
- Prevention of invalid mode strings

## Integration Points

### With Week 1 Implementation
- **Builds on**: Basic selection operations (selectObject, selectObjects, deselectObject, etc.)
- **Extends**: Adds mode management layer on top of existing selection state
- **Compatible**: All 34 Week 1 tests continue to pass

### With CanvasSyncManager
- **Event Wiring**: Already implemented in Week 1
- **Fabric.js Events**: selection:created, selection:updated, selection:cleared
- **Sync Flags**: Prevents infinite loops between canvas and state

### With Future Features
- **Lasso Selection**: Mode prepared, implementation in future sprint
- **Drag Selection**: Mode prepared, implementation in future sprint
- **Multi-Select UI**: Mode enables multi-selection interactions

---

## Files Modified

1. **src/stores/slices/selectionSlice.ts** (+32 lines)
   - Added SelectionMode type
   - Added selectionMode state
   - Implemented setSelectionMode()

2. **src/stores/__tests__/selectionSlice.test.ts** (+222 lines)
   - Added 11 selection mode tests
   - Added 4 integration tests with canvasStore

## Next Steps (W2.D2)

### History Store Slice (Undo/Redo)
- Create historySlice with undo/redo stacks
- Implement action recording and replay
- Wire history to canvas operations
- Add keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+Z, Cmd+Shift+Z)

**Preparation**:
- Review Command pattern for action recording
- Design history state structure
- Plan history limits and optimization

---

## Learnings

### What Went Well
1. **Week 1 Foundation**: Basic selection operations already implemented saved significant time
2. **TDD Approach**: RED→GREEN cycle caught mode switching edge cases early
3. **Integration Tests**: Canvas store integration tests validated cross-slice behavior

### Technical Insights
1. **Mode Switching Complexity**: Mode transitions require careful consideration of user expectations
2. **State Independence**: Separating selection state from canvas objects provides flexibility
3. **Fabric.js Integration**: Existing event wiring from Week 1 worked seamlessly with new modes

### Process Improvements
1. **Incremental Enhancement**: Building on Week 1 implementation was faster than starting fresh
2. **Test Coverage**: Integration tests caught issues that unit tests missed
3. **Documentation**: Clear mode switching logic in comments aids future maintenance
